**Shield Space** is a secure platform designed for organizing private, privacy-preserving events. It empowers event organizers to host safe, confidential gatherings without exposing sensitive information about attendees or event details. Ideal for communities that prioritize security, such as domestic violence survivors [Our use-case (**SafeLink**)], Shield Space ensures that personal data remains protected, allowing participants to connect and engage without fear of online harassment or unwanted exposure.

‚öôÔ∏è **Built using:** iExec, Secret Network, Bandada, Aztec, Scaffold-ETH2.

üïµÔ∏è **Private Event Creation:** Events are invisible to the public; only invited users can access event details. All event information is encrypted using Secret Network.

üîè **Secure Verification:** Attendees can be invited using wallet address (will be notified via e-mail) using iExec tech stack. In case of further verification needed only limited and encrypted information will be shared as proof (e.g., gender, age, etc.), without needing to share full personal data using Aztec Network (zkPassport-when open sourced again).

üõë **No Unnecessary Sharing:** Survivors‚Äô identities are kept anonymous unless they choose to disclose more, limiting exposure to online harassment using privacy-by-default approach.

üëÅÔ∏è **Organizers Overview:** Only information that event organizers see is amount of (verified ‚Äì if needed) participants, keeping survivors safe from unwanted visibility.

üõ°Ô∏è **Harassment Prevention:** Secure communication channels/groups ensure that interactions between organizers and survivors are free from online harassment risks using Bandada groups adding a layer of privacy with a strong anti-sybil system.
