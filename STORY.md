**October is the Domestic Violence Awareness month.** *"Every1 knows some1".*

Event organizers dedicated to supporting sensitive communities face significant challenges when planning and hosting in-person events. E.g. maintaining the utmost privacy and security for domestic violence survivors [Our use-case (SafeLink)], who may fear exposing their identity and personal details online. Current tools often lack the ability to ensure the anonymity, confidentiality and secured verification needed to protect survivors from further harm, such as online harassment or unwanted tracking.

There is a pressing need for a secure, discreet platform that allows event organizers to create, manage, and invite attendees to private events without compromising the safety of the participants.

# Project Description
Shield Space is a secure platform designed to empower event organizers to host private, in-person support events for sensitive communities without exposing sensitive information online. The platform prioritizes privacy by allowing organizers to create events that are not publicly visible and invite attendees based on specific criteria such as e.g. gender or age – without revealing unnecessary personal details.

Attendees can be invited to these events and notified via email using **iExec Web3Mail** technology, and confirming their eligibility via ZK proofs submitted to **Aztec**. All the event details are hidden and later revealed via **Secret Network** and attendees are group together in privacy-preserving way via **Badada** system.

Shield Space aims to provide a safe, secure, and private environment for event organizers and sensitive communities members, minimizing exposure to personal risk while facilitating in-person support gatherings.

# Our choice of use-case
Fictional community called **SafeLink** aims to organize private, and privacy-preserving gatherings for domestic violence survivors. Courage to Heal is a heartfelt and empowering gathering offering a safe and supportive space for those on the journey toward healing and recovery.

This event is a reminder that *courage isn’t the absence of fear – it’s taking a step forward despite it.*
